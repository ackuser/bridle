{"name":"Bridle","tagline":"Beautiful Javascript graphs and charts using D3.js","body":"### What is bridle?\r\nBridle is a repository of charts built following the [reusable chart paradigm](bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/). The library is in its infancy, and still requires a bunch of work. We decided to still use d3 to invoke the chart, so that you can integrate them in your d3 workflow as seamlessly as possible\r\n\r\n![line chart example](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/68514/bridle_line_chart_ex.png \"line chart example\")\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nFirst of all you create a _chart generator_ by invoking the function of the chart you want to use:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar chart = Bridle.LineChart()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis call returns a _chart generator function_, much like `d3.axis` returns an axis generator. In order to customise the chart, you can call the different getters/setters of the function:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nchart\r\n  .width(900)\r\n  .height(400)\r\n  .title('Oranges are healthy')\r\n  .yAxisTitle('Vitamin C content')\r\n```\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n### What's in a name?\r\nAt Pearson Technology we're building a data analytics project called Palomino. Palomino is a coat colour in horses, and since this library is part of the Palomino project, we chose something horse related. The idea is that the bridle is what helps you direct a horse and connects you to it.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
